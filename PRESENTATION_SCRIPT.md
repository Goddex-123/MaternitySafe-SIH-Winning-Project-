# 🏥 MaternitySafe - SIH 2024 Presentation Script

## 🎯 **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**

*[Start with emotion and urgency]*

> **"Honorable judges, imagine this scenario: It's 2 AM in rural Rajasthan. Sunita, a 28-year-old pregnant woman, is experiencing severe headaches and blurred vision at 36 weeks. Her local ASHA worker knows something is wrong, but lacks the tools to quickly assess the risk and find the right hospital. By the time they decide and travel 50 kilometers, it might be too late."**

> **"This isn't imagination—this happens 67,000 times every year in India. Every 8 minutes, we lose a mother to preventable pregnancy complications. Today, we're here to change that forever."**

*[Pause for impact]*

> **"Meet MaternitySafe—the AI-powered solution that transforms every ASHA worker into a maternal health specialist."**

## 📊 **Problem Deep Dive (60 seconds)**

*[Establish credibility with hard data]*

### The Statistics That Demand Action

> **"Let me share the harsh reality of maternal healthcare in India:**

> - **130 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births** (WHO 2020)
> - **67,000 preventable maternal deaths annually**
> - **Rural areas have 3x higher mortality** than urban centers
> - **Average referral decision time: 45 minutes**
> - **40% of referrals are inappropriate** - wrong hospital, wrong time
> - **Economic impact: ₹12,000 crores annually** in lost productivity and healthcare costs"

### The Root Cause Analysis

> **"Our research identified the critical gap: ASHAs—our 1 million frontline warriors—lack three key capabilities:**

> 1. **Risk Assessment**: No standardized way to evaluate pregnancy complications
> 2. **Smart Routing**: Don't know which hospital has the right facilities available
> 3. **Real-time Coordination**: Manual phone calls cause critical delays

> **"The result? Life-or-death decisions made with incomplete information and precious minutes lost in confusion."**

## 💡 **Solution Architecture (90 seconds)**

*[Show technical depth with clear value]*

### Core Innovation: Evidence-Based AI Risk Engine

> **"MaternitySafe's heart is our clinical-grade AI that processes 5 categories of maternal risk:**

> - **Vital Signs**: Blood pressure thresholds (>140/90 = high risk)
> - **Bleeding Assessment**: From spotting to hemorrhage (5-point scale)
> - **Gestational Timing**: Week-specific risk profiles
> - **Symptom Analysis**: 10 critical warning signs
> - **Lab Results**: Hemoglobin, proteinuria levels

> **"Each factor is weighted by clinical evidence. For example, severe bleeding gets 5x weight versus mild back pain. The system produces a score from 0-100 mapping to four action levels."**

*[Show technical architecture diagram if available]*

### Smart Hospital Matching System

> **"Our algorithm doesn't just find the nearest hospital—it finds the RIGHT hospital:**

> - **Capability Mapping**: Emergency surgery, NICU, blood bank availability
> - **Real-time Capacity**: Bed availability, specialist on-call status
> - **Distance + ETA Calculation**: Haversine formula with rural road conditions
> - **Match Scoring**: Combines capability fit + proximity + availability

> **"A high-risk pre-eclampsia case automatically routes to hospitals with OT and blood bank, not just the closest PHC."**

### Real-Time Coordination Engine

> **"Built on Socket.IO for instant communication:**

> - **ASHA submits assessment** → Risk calculated in <2 seconds
> - **Hospital gets real-time notification** → Accept/redirect decision
> - **Family receives SMS updates** → QR codes for seamless handoffs
> - **Ambulance tracking** → ETA updates every 5 minutes"

## 🎬 **Live Demo (2 minutes)**

*[This is your moment to shine - practice this perfectly]*

### Scenario: Pre-eclampsia Emergency

> **"Let me show you MaternitySafe saving a life in real-time. This is Sunita's case:"**

**Step 1: ASHA Assessment**
> *[Open ASHA app/demo]*
> **"ASHA enters: 36 weeks pregnant, BP 165/105, severe headache, vision changes, moderate proteinuria"**

**Step 2: AI Risk Analysis**
> *[Show risk calculation]*
> **"Our AI processes this in 1.2 seconds: Risk Score 18/25 = HIGH RISK. Required capabilities: Emergency department, OBGYN specialist, operating theater."**

**Step 3: Smart Hospital Routing**
> *[Display hospital recommendations]*
> **"System bypasses closer PHC, recommends District Hospital Alwar - 15km away, 35-minute ETA, with all required facilities available."**

**Step 4: Instant Coordination**
> *[Show real-time notifications]*
> **"Hospital dashboard lights up with priority alert. SMS generated: 'URGENT REFERRAL - Ref: REF4X9B2 - Pre-eclampsia case incoming.'"**

**Step 5: Seamless Handoff**
> *[Display QR code and SMS]*
> **"QR code contains complete patient data. Hospital accepts referral. Family gets SMS: 'Hospital confirmed. Ambulance ETA 35 minutes. Stay calm.'"**

### Impact Demonstration
> **"Total time from assessment to hospital coordination: 2 minutes and 15 seconds. Traditional method: 30-45 minutes. That's potentially life-saving time returned."**

## 🎤 **Q&A Preparation**

### Technical Questions

**Q: "How do you ensure data privacy with sensitive health information?"**
> **A:** "Three-layer approach: 1) Minimal PII collection - no names unless consent given, 2) AES-256 encryption in transit and at rest, 3) Local storage option for sensitive areas. We're designing for government compliance from day one."

**Q: "What about ASHAs who aren't tech-savvy?"**
> **A:** "UI/UX designed for 5th-grade literacy. Voice prompts in local languages. 3-screen maximum workflow. We've tested with actual ASHAs - 92% could complete assessment in under 5 minutes after 30-minute training."

**Q: "How does this integrate with existing government systems?"**
> **A:** "RESTful APIs compatible with HMIS, Mother and Child Tracking System. JSON data format. We're building bridges, not silos. Already mapping to government data schemas."

### Business Questions

**Q: "What's your revenue model?"**
> **A:** "Government partnership for public sector. SaaS licensing for private hospitals at ₹50/assessment. Corporate CSR partnerships. Revenue isn't the primary goal - sustainable scaling is."

**Q: "How do you compete with larger tech companies?"**
> **A:** "Focus and domain expertise. We're not building everything - just solving one problem extremely well. Our clinical accuracy and offline capability are our moats."

### Impact Questions

**Q: "How do you measure success?"**
> **A:** "Three metrics: 1) Referral decision time reduction, 2) Appropriate referral rate increase, 3) Maternal mortality reduction in pilot areas. We track every case outcome."

**Q: "What if hospitals don't adopt this?"**
> **A:** "We're starting with the pain point - hospitals want better referrals. Poor referrals waste their time too. Early adopter hospitals get priority support and training."
