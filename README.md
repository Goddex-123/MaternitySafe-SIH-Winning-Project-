# MaternitySafe â€” Community Prenatal Risk Detection & Smart Referral

**Tagline:** Early detection + fast referrals to reduce maternal & neonatal risks in resource-limited areas.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Problem Statement

In many parts of India pregnant women miss early detection of dangerous signs (pre-eclampsia, hemorrhage risk, anemia, fetal distress) because community health workers (ASHAs/ANMs) and small clinics lack quick screening tools, risk-triaging, and a smooth referral path to the nearest capable facility. That causes preventable maternal & neonatal morbidity and mortality.

## Solution Overview

A lightweight PWA + offline-capable mobile app for ASHAs/ANMs that: collects simple structured data + measurements, computes an evidence-based risk score, recommends next steps (home care / urgent referral), finds the nearest capable facility (beds/OT/OBGYN on-call), generates a referral packet (SMS/IVR + QR), and gives a dispatcher/hospital dashboard to accept/refuse referrals â€” reducing referral delays and inappropriate transfers.

## Why This Wins SIH

- âœ… Clear public health impact (maternal mortality)
- âœ… Feasible to build in a hackathon (rule-based triage + simple inventory mock)
- âœ… Demoable, emotional, and reproducible
- âœ… Scalable & privacy-minded: store minimal PII, encrypt transport, offline-first

## MVP Features

### 1. ASHA App (PWA/Mobile)
- Simple form (gestational age, BP, urine test results, fetal movement, bleeding, symptoms)
- Offline-first + local storage
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### 2. Risk Engine
- Rule-based scoring (e.g., BP >140/90 = high risk; bleeding = emergency)
- Produces Low / Medium / High risk levels
- Evidence-based clinical rules

### 3. Referral Generator
- Recommends nearest hospital with maternity capability
- Generates SMS + QR referral code containing minimal case info
- Smart routing based on hospital capabilities

### 4. Hospital Dashboard
- Shows incoming referrals
- Bed/OT/OB availability (mock)
- Accept / Redirect functionality

### 5. Dispatcher Flow
- One-click ambulance request (simulated)
- Family notification system

### 6. Demo Mode
- Seed multiple ASHA devices and hospitals
- Run "saved mother" scenarios

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React PWA (offline-capable)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** SQLite/Postgres (Firebase for rapid prototyping)
- **Real-time:** Socket.IO
